 # Network Cards
 
 A network card is a three-panel tabular summary of a network dataset:
 
 <p align='center'>
-<img src='network-card-example.png' alt='Example network card for the Zachary Karate Club' width='600'>
+<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/network-cards/network-cards/main/network-card-example.png' alt='Example network card for the Zachary Karate Club' width='600'>
 </p>
 
 The first panel provides an overall summary of the network, the second summarizes the structure of the network (size, density, connectivity), and the third panel provides additional meta-information, what metadata are associated with nodes and links, how were the data gathered, and so forth.
 
 Network cards are intended to be _concise, readable and flexible_, allowing researchers across fields to quickly read and understand studies involving network datasets. 
 We believe that a standard representation is crucial to ensuring that key information associated with network data remains available.
 
 This repository provides [templates](templates/) and a [Python package](#install) to create, update, and export network cards.

+
+
+## Example
+
+`Network Cards` provides [fill-in templates](templates/) but you can also generate and save a card programmatically. 
+Here's Python code where we load a network from a file and compute the basic card: 
+
+```python
+import networkx as nx
+import network_cards as nc
+
+G = nx.read_edgelist("karate_club.edgelist")
+
+card = nc.NetworkCard(G)
+print(card)
+```
+This gives:
+
+```text

+              Nodes are

+         Considerations

+          Node metadata                       
+          Link metadata                       
+       Date of creation                       
+Data generating process

+                Funding                       
+               Citation                       
+
+^1: Distributions summarized with average [min, max].
+```
+
+Unfortunately, few of the important definitions, details or meta-information are computable, so
+most of the fields outside the structure panel are blank.
+Let's use `update_*` methods to populate the remaining fields ourselves:
+
+```python
+card.update_overall("Name", "Zachary Karate Club")
+card.update_overall("Nodes are", "Members of club at US university")
+card.update_overall("Links are", "Members consistently interacted outside club")
+card.update_overall("Considerations", "Heavily used as an example network")
+
+card.update_metainfo({
+    "Node metadata":           "None",
+    "Link metadata":           "None (original study included eight interaction contexts)",
+    "Date of creation":        "1977",
+    "Data generating process": "Direct observation of club members during period 1970-72",
+    "Funding":                 "None",
+    "Citation":                "Zachary (1977)"
+    })
+```
+
+We used `card.update_overall()` and `card.update_metainfo()` to insert entries into the previous card. 
+Entries can be updated one at a time (like we did when updating the overall panel) or a dictionary can be passed to update multiple entries at once.
+
+Now, print the revised card with `print(card)`:
+
+```text
+                   Name                                       Zachary Karate Club

meta-information are computable, so\nmost of the fields outside the structure panel are blank.\nLet\'s use `update_*` methods to populate the remaining fields ourselves:\n\n```python\ncard.update_overall("Name", "Zachary Karate Club")\ncard.update_overall("Nodes are", "Members of club at US university")\ncard.update_overall("Links are", "Members consistently interacted outside club")\ncard.update_overall("Considerations", "Heavily used as an example network")\n\ncard.update_metainfo({\n    "Node metadata":           "None",\n    "Link metadata":           "None (original study included eight interaction contexts)",\n    "Date of creation":        "1977",\n    "Data generating process": "Direct observation of club members during period 1970-72",\n    "Funding":                 "None",\n    "Citation":                "Zachary (1977)"\n    })\n```\n\nWe used `card.update_overall()` and `card.update_metainfo()` to insert entries into the previous card. \nEntries can be updated one at a time (like we did when updating the overall panel) or a dictionary can be passed to update multiple entries at once.\n\nNow, print the revised card with `print(card)`:\n\n```text\n                   Name                                       Zachary Karate Club\n                   Kind                                    Undirected,
